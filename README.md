# AWS_S3_Library
This is a repository of Python scripts to manage and test Amazon Web Services S3 buckets.  There are also Python files to use for demonstartion purposes of the tools/functions available in the library.  These demos are to be used/run from the command line.

The base scripts in file_transfer, s3_bucket_management, and s3_versioning will be used as base libraries for data analysis applications in which the application scripts willbe used to target specific resources. Inevitably the base scripts will be evolved to meet the requirements of the projects.

Beyond this the project will incorporate the use of AWS Athena and other tools to facilitate creation of full featured applications.
